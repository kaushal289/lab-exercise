1 Write a program that takes three numbers and print their sum. Every number is given on a seperate line.
2 write a program that reads the length of the base and the height of a right-angled
triangle and prints the area.  Every number is given on a separate line
3 N students takes K apples and distribute them among each other evenly. The remaning
(the undivisible) part remains in the basket.How many apples will each single students get?
 How many apples remain in the basket? The program reads the number N and K. It should print the two
   answers for the question above.
4 Given the integer N - the number of minutes that is passed science midnight - how many hours and
minutes are displayed on the 24h digital clock? The program should print two numbers: the number of
hours (between 0 and 23) and the number of minutes (between 0 and 59).
For example, if N=150, than 150 minutes have passed since midnight - i .e. now is 2:30 am.
So, the program should print 2:30.
5 A school decided to replace the desks in three classroom. Each desk sits two students.
Given the number of students in each class. Print the smallest possible number of desks that can be
purchased.
The program should read three integers: the number of students in each of the three classes, a,b and c respectively.
6. Solve each of the following problems using python Script. Make sure you  use  appropriate variable name
 and comments. When there is a final answer have Python print it to the screen.
 A person's body mass index(BM) is defined as:
 BMI= mass in kg/(height in m)^2.
7 You live 4 miles from the university. The bus drives at 25mph but spends 2 minutes at each of
the 10 stops on the way. How long will the bus journey take? Alternatively, you could run to university.
You jog the first mile at 7 mph; then run the next two at 15mph; before jogging the last at 7 mph  again.
 Will this be quicker or slower than the bus?
8 Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area.(area of
circle=PI*r^2)
9 Write a python program to find sum of the first n positive integers.
sum=(n*(n+1))/2'
10 Write a python program to convert seconds to day,hours, minutes and seconds.
